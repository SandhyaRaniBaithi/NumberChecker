Create a simple UI with one input field that accepts only numbers.

If the user types negative numbers, show "enter a positive value".
If the user types an even number, show the next 3 even numbers.
If the user types an odd number, show the next 3 odd numbers.

The Number Checker project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an input field for users to enter a number and a button to check if the number is even or odd. The HTML handles the structure, CSS provides styling, and JavaScript adds functionality. The script is linked to validate input and display results dynamically.

The Number Checker uses JavaScript to validate and process user input. It checks if the input is empty or not a number, prompting the user to enter a valid number. If the number is negative, it asks for a positive number. For valid input, it displays the next three even or odd numbers based on the input type.
